# Auto Generate API Documentation from the Insomnia File Export

## Version
### 0.0.1

## Support
Only support for one workspace from the Insomnia file export

## Insomnia support export format
So far I've only tested from insomnia export JSON format (V4). And going well.

## Insomnia
Always copy/paste the last response to description before export workspace.<br> 
`with Markdown format` <br>
`Click Docs -> Add Description -> Paste Respose to Column Write a Description -> Close.`

## How to use Auto Generate API Documentation
1. Export data from Insomnia (Current workspace)<br>
    `Click Arrow in your Workspace -> Import/Export -> Export Data -> Current Workspace -> Export -> Done.`
2. Replace `data.json` in the root folder with the file downloaded earlier. 
    Don't rename the file, keep the name `data.json`.
